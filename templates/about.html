    <h1>About EcoSort AI</h1>
    <p>
      EcoSort AI is an intelligent waste classification system that empowers communities and municipal bodies 
      to take control of waste segregation using the power of artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developed as a green-tech solution, EcoSort AI can distinguish between various types of waste 
      (organic, recyclable, hazardous, and general) from images â€” making recycling smarter and easier than ever.
